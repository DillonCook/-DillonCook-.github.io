        <h2>(How To Do) Regular Maintenance?</h2>
        <p><span>With</span> your frequent filter changes and careful trimming around your outside unit, 
            your system should give you years of trouble free service.  Most trouble is caused 
            by organic particles in indoor air making a mess in your air handler.  Your monthly 
            filter changing is the most effective solution to this air quality and maintenance 
            problem.  Remember spray chemicals corrode your machine causing damage and leaks.  
            UV Lights are unreliable, full of mercury, and manufactured in 3rd world countries 
            and do not remove dandruff, sneeze spray, and smoke from cooking.  Air filters do!  
            <br /><br /><span>So</span> give yourself a break and take care of your filters.  Our hot, humid, long summers 
            demand it, that is Step 1 for maintenance.  When something doesn’t feel or sound right, 
            give Wesley Chapel A/C a call and we’ll take care of it, that is Step 2.<br /><br />
            <span>Wesley Chapel A/C</span> Company provides a wide spectrum of essential heating and air 
                conditioning services as we maintain extremely competitive pricing, without 
                compromising quality. We strive to provide the highest level of service, and 
                client satisfaction by setting realistic expectations, and exceeding those 
                expectations.</p>
        <h2>Do I Need a Tune-Up??</h2>
        <p><span>If</span> your goal is to enjoy the longest possible trouble free service from 
            your HVAC equipment and you don’t want to be a cash cow for some big A/C company, 
            your expectations are not too high.  Scheduled maintenance intervals can be two 
            years or longer under the right conditions.  Your monthly filter replacement is the 
            most important maintenance program available, I can’t say enough about it.<br /><br />
            <span>Beyond</span> filters a few things should be looked after outside every few years by someone 
            who knows what they are doing and has your best interest in mind, that is where we come 
            in.  A real routine maintenance visit will take some time and cannot be done with a magic 
            wand.  It requires a water hose, some tools, and a lot of care, so don’t fall for the 
            cheap coupon advertisement tune-up.  Do it right or don’t do it at all, either way you 
            are better off.</p>
        <h2>Service Agreements???</h2>
        <p><span>These</span> agreements seek to maintain a relationship with the customer using periodic maintenance 
            and membership gimmicks as a hook.</p>
        <h5>Reality:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Unless your system has a unique problem, maintenance intervals are at least one 
                (1) year apart if not longer. Residential systems have no belts to tighten, motor 
                bearings are sealed and require no lubrication, and refrigerant circuits are hermetically 
                sealed and should not have trash, air, and acids introduced by constant connections to 
                various gauge sets.</li>
            <li>Spring cleaning chemicals on coils will corrode and damage them - causing leaks.</li>
            <li>Technicians are paid a percentage of everything that they can sell so frequent maintenance equals 
                frequent sales opportunities.</li>
            <li><strong>Don't be a victim!</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span>Change</span> your air filter once a month to keep your unit clean and call us to correct problems. 
            Not make them!  If preventive maintenance is require, just call us, no contract required.</p>
